# Welcome to ReactJS
## A 2014 Polyglot Conference Workshop

React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces that challenges some fundamental assumptions about how user interfaces should be built. In this workshop, you will learn to "think in React," as you build an interactive, data-driven, client-server web application in the browser.

First, we will learn what's distinctive about the React approach, and how we can benefit from it. Next, we will learn how React components are built, how they operate, how they communicate with each other, and how to test them. Along the way, in pairs or small groups, we will laugh, cry, scream, and cheer, but ultimately build some working software, the React Way.

### About the facilitator

Steven Luscher builds web and mobile applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, and Objective-C. En-route to becoming a polyglot coder, he made stops along the way to pursue formal education in graphic design, mathematics, and pedagogy; experiences which have served him well in the area of web application development.

In 2013, he delivered a [conference talk about React](https://github.com/steveluscher/react-supervanjs-2013) at Super VanJS. He currently works full-time developing a mammoth React-based application using Coffeescript, JSX, Node, and MongoDB.

He does not work for Facebook.
